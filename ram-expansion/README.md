# Memory Expansion model roscram-01

This is a memory expansion for the rosco_m68k. It uses static
RAM (AS6C4008, the same memory chip as the on-board RAM) and
supports 1MB-4MB of RAM per board.

Multiple RAM expansions can co-exist in the same system due
to the base address for the expansion being selectable by 
three jumpers on the board.
